                    <p><strong>Time Sharing Operating system</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Provides the advantage of quick response.</li>
                    <li> Avoids duplication of software.</li>
                    <li>Reduces CPU idle time</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    <p><strong>Advantages of Batch Operating system</strong></p>
                    <ul> 
                    <li>Repeated jobs are done fast in batch systems without user interaction.</li>
                    <li> You do not need special hardware and system support to input data in batch systems</li>
                    <li>Best for large organizations but small organizations can also benefit from it.</li>
                    <li>Batch systems can work offline so it makes less stress on processor.</li>
                    <li>Processor consumes good time while processing that mean it knows which job to process next.</li>
                    <li>The batch systems can manage large repeated work easily.</li>
                    <li>You can assign specific time for the batch jobs so when the computer is idle it starts processing the batch jobs i.e. at night or any free time.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Network Operating System</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Centralized servers are highly stable.</li>
                        <li>Security is server managed.</li>
                        <li>Upgrades to new technologies and hardware can be easily integrated into the system.</li>
                        <li>Remote access to servers is possible from different locations and types of systems.</li>
                        
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Real Time Operating System</strong></p>
                    <p>There are two types of Real time operating suystem</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hard real-time systems guarantee that critical tasks complete on time. In hard real-time systems, secondary storage is limited or missing and the data is stored in ROM. In these systems, virtual memory is almost never found.

</li>
                      
                        <li>Soft real-time systems are less restrictive. A critical real-time task gets priority over other tasks and retains the priority until it completes. Soft real-time systems have limited utility than hard real-time systems. For example, multimedia, virtual reality, Advanced Scientific Projects like undersea exploration and planetary rovers, etc.</li>
